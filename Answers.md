1. What is the purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.printReverse?
- The purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.printReverse is to have the items inputted be added to predetermined lists and stacks.

2. Why do these methods need to have arguments, and how does the argument change from one recursive call to the next?
- These methods need to have arguments because they build upon one another to ultimately reach the desired result, and the argument changes from one recursive call to the next by referring to one another.

3. What are the time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as ReverseLines.printReverse?
- The time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as ReverseLines.printReverse is O(n).

4. Which of these methods can be implemented using while loops?
- All of these methods can be implemented using while loops.
